<h1>WinActivate</h1>

<p>Activates the specified window.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">WinActivate</span> <span class="optional">WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a>, <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#objects">Object</a></p>
    <p>If each of these is blank or omitted, the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">Last Found Window</a> will be used. Otherwise, specify for <em>WinTitle</em> a <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm">window title or other criteria</a> to identify the target window and/or for <em>WinText</em> a substring from a single text element of the target window (as revealed by the included Window Spy utility).</p>
    <p><em>ExcludeTitle</em> and <em>ExcludeText</em> can be used to exclude one or more windows by their title or text. Their specification is similar to <em>WinTitle</em> and <em>WinText</em>, except that <em>ExcludeTitle</em> does not recognize any criteria other than the window title.</p>
    <p>Window titles and text are case-sensitive. By default, hidden windows are not detected and hidden text elements are detected, unless changed with <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> and <a href="DetectHiddenText.htm">DetectHiddenText</a>. By default, a window title can contain <em>WinTitle</em> or <em>ExcludeTitle</em> anywhere inside it to be a match, unless changed with <a href="SetTitleMatchMode.htm">SetTitleMatchMode</a>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#TargetError">TargetError</a> is thrown if the window could not be found.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>When an inactive window becomes active, the operating system also makes it foremost (brings it to the top of the stack). This does not occur if the window is already active.</p>
<p>If the window is minimized and inactive, it is automatically restored prior to being activated. If <em>WinTitle</em> is the letter "A" and the other parameters are omitted, the active window is restored. The window is restored even if it was already active.</p>
<p>Six attempts will be made to activate the target window over the course of 60&nbsp;ms. If all six attempts fail, WinActivate automatically sends <code class="no-highlight">{Alt 2}</code> as a workaround for possible restrictions enforced by the operating system, and then makes a seventh attempt. Thus, it is usually unnecessary to follow WinActivate with <a href="WinWaitActive.htm">WinWaitActive</a> or <code>if not <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>(...)</code>.</p>
<p>After WinActivate's first failed attempt, it automatically sends <code>{Alt up}</code>. Testing has shown that this may improve the reliability of all subsequent attempts, reducing the number of instances where the first attempt fails and causes the taskbar button to flash. No more than one <code>{Alt up}</code> is sent for this purpose for the lifetime of each script. If this or any other (AutoHotkey v1.1.27+) script has a keyboard hook installed, the <code>{Alt up}</code> is blocked from the active window, minimizing the already small risk of side-effects.</p>
<p>In general, if more than one window matches, the topmost matching window (typically the one most recently used) will be activated. If the window is already active, it will be kept active rather than activating any other matching window beneath it. However, if the active window is moved to the bottom of the stack with <a href="WinMoveBottom.htm">WinMoveBottom</a>, some other window may be activated even if the active window is a match.</p>
<p><a href="WinActivateBottom.htm">WinActivateBottom</a> activates the bottommost matching window (typically the one least recently used).</p>
<p><a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> activates the next window that matches criteria specified by a window group.</p>
<p>If the active window is hidden and <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> is turned off, it is never considered a match. Instead, a visible matching window is activated if one exists.</p>
<p>When a window is activated immediately after the activation of some other window, task bar buttons might start flashing on some systems (depending on OS and settings). To prevent this, use <a href="_WinActivateForce.htm">#WinActivateForce</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Known issue:</strong> If the script is running on a computer or server being accessed via remote desktop, WinActivate may hang if the remote desktop client is minimized. One workaround is to use built-in functions which don't require window activation, such as <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> and <a href="ControlClick.htm">ControlClick</a>. Another possible workaround is to apply the following registry setting on the local/client computer:</p>
<pre><em>; Change HKCU to HKLM to affect all users on this system.</em>
RegWrite "REG_DWORD", "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"
    , "RemoteDesktop_SuppressWhenMinimized", 2</pre>
