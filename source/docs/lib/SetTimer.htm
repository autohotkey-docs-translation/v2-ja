<h1>SetTimer</h1>

<p>Causes a function to be called automatically and repeatedly at a specified time interval.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SetTimer</span> <span class="optional">Function, Period, Priority</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt id="Function">Function</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Object</a></p>
    <p>The function object to call.</p>
    <p>A <a href="../Concepts.htm#references-to-objects">reference</a> to the function object is kept in the script's list of timers, and is not released unless the timer is deleted.  This occurs automatically for <a href="#once">run-once</a> timers, but can also be done by calling SetTimer with a <em>Period</em> of 0.</p>
    <p id="OmitCallback">If <em>Function</em> is omitted, SetTimer will operate on the timer which launched the current thread, if any. For example, <code>SetTimer , 0</code> can be used inside a timer function to mark the timer for deletion, while <code>SetTimer , 1000</code> would update the current timer's <em>Period</em>.</p>
    <p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Passing an empty variable or an expression which results in an empty value is considered an error. This parameter must be either given a non-empty value or completely omitted.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Period</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If omitted and the timer does not exist, it will be created with a period of 250. If omitted and the timer already exists, it will be <a href="#reset">reset</a> at its former period unless <em>Priority</em> is specified. Otherwise, the absolute value of this parameter is used as the <a href="#Precision">approximate</a> number of milliseconds that must pass before the timer is executed. The timer will be automatically <a href="#reset">reset</a>. It can be set to repeat automatically or run only once:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If <em>Period</em> is greater than 0, the timer will automatically repeat until it is explicitly disabled by the script.</li>
      <li id="once">If <em>Period</em> is less than 0, the timer will run only once. For example, specifying -100 would call <em>Function</em> 100&nbsp;ms from now then delete the timer as though <code>SetTimer <i>Function</i>, 0</code> had been used.</li>
      <li>If <em>Period</em> is 0, the timer is marked for deletion. If a thread started by this timer is still running, the timer is deleted after the thread finishes (unless it has been reenabled); otherwise, it is deleted immediately. In any case, the timer's previous <em>Period</em> and <em>Priority</em> are not retained.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The absolute value of <em>Period</em> must be no larger than 4294967295&nbsp;ms (49.7 days).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Priority</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If omitted, it defaults to 0. Otherwise, specify an integer between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (or an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>) to indicate this timer's thread priority. See <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> for details.</p>
    <p>To change the priority of an existing timer without affecting it in any other way, omit <em>Period</em>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Timers are useful because they run asynchronously, meaning that they will run at the specified frequency (interval) even when the script is  waiting for a window, displaying a dialog, or busy with another task. Examples of their many uses include taking some action when the user becomes idle (as reflected by <a href="../Variables.htm#TimeIdle">A_TimeIdle</a>) or closing unwanted windows the moment they appear.</p>
<p>Although timers may give the illusion that the script is performing more than one task simultaneously, this is not the case. Instead, timed functions are treated just like other threads: they can interrupt or be interrupted by another thread, such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey subroutine</a>. See <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> for details.</p>
<p>Whenever a timer is created or updated with a new period, its function will not be called right away; its time period must expire first. If you wish the timer's first execution to be immediate, call the timer's function directly (however, this will not start a new thread like the timer itself does; so settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> will not start off at their defaults).</p>
<p id="reset"><strong>Reset:</strong> If SetTimer is used on an existing timer, the timer is reset (unless <em>Priority</em> is specified and <em>Period</em> is omitted); in other words, the entirety of its period must elapse before its function will be called again.</p>
<p id="Precision"><strong>Timer precision:</strong> Due to the granularity of the OS's time-keeping system, <em>Period</em> is typically rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 or 15.6 milliseconds (depending on the type of hardware and drivers installed). A shorter delay may be achieved via Loop+Sleep as demonstrated at <a href="Sleep.htm#ExShorterSleep">DllCall+timeBeginPeriod+Sleep</a>.</p>
<p id="Reliability"><strong>Reliability:</strong> A timer might not be able to run at the expected time under the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Other applications are putting a heavy load on the CPU.</li>
  <li>The timer's function is still running when the timer period expires again.</li>
  <li>There are too many other competing timers.</li>
  <li>The timer has been interrupted by another <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, namely another timed function, <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey subroutine</a>, or <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a> (this can be avoided via <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a>). If this happens and the interrupting thread takes a long time to finish, the interrupted timer will be effectively disabled for the duration. However, any other timers will continue to run by interrupting the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> that interrupted the first timer.</li>
  <li>The script is uninterruptible as a result of <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> or <a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt/Priority</a>. During such times, timers will not run. Later, when the script becomes interruptible again, any overdue timer will run once as soon as possible and then resume its normal schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although timers will operate when the script is <a href="Suspend.htm">suspended</a>, they will not run if the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> has <a href="Thread.htm#NoTimers">Thread NoTimers</a> in effect or whenever any thread is <a href="Pause.htm">paused</a>. In addition, they do not operate when the user is navigating through one of the script's menus (such as the <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a> menu or a menu bar).</p>
<p>Because timers operate by temporarily interrupting the script's current activity, their functions should be kept short (so that they finish  quickly) whenever a long interruption would be undesirable.</p>
<p id="otherremarks"><strong>Other remarks:</strong> A temporary timer might often be disabled by its own function (see examples at the bottom of this page).</p>
<p>Whenever a function is called by a timer, it starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>
<p>If <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> response time is crucial (such as in games) and the script contains any timers whose functions take longer than about 5&nbsp;ms to execute, use the following function to avoid any chance of a 15&nbsp;ms delay. Such a delay would otherwise happen if a hotkey is pressed at the exact moment a timer thread is in its period of uninterruptibility:</p>
<pre><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a> "Interrupt", 0  <em>; Make all threads always-interruptible.</em></pre>
<p>If a timer is disabled while its function is currently running, that function will continue until it completes.</p>
<p>The <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> feature shows how many timers exist and how many are currently enabled.</p>

        <em>; Tick() has an implicit parameter "this" which is a reference to

    }
    Start() {
        SetTimer this.timer, this.interval
        ToolTip "Counter started"

    Stop() {
        <em>; To turn off the timer, we must pass the same object as before:</em>
        SetTimer this.timer, 0
        ToolTip "Counter stopped at " this.count
    }
    <em>; In this example, the timer calls this method:</em>
    Tick() {
        ToolTip ++this.count
    }
}</pre>
<p>Tips relating to the above example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can also use <code>this.timer := this.Tick.<a href="Func.htm#Bind">Bind</a>(this)</code>.  When <code>this.timer</code> is called, it will effectively invoke <code><i>tick_function</i>.<a href="Func.htm#Call">Call</a>(this)</code>, where <i>tick_function</i> is the function object which implements that method. By contrast, <a href="ObjBindMethod.htm">ObjBindMethod</a> produces an object which invokes <code>this.Tick()</code>.</li>
  <li>If we rename <em>Tick</em> to <em>Call</em>, we can just use <code>this</code> directly instead of <code>this.timer</code>.  However, ObjBindMethod is useful when the object has multiple methods which should be called by different event sources, such as hotkeys, menu items, GUI controls, etc.</li>
  <li>If the timer is being modified or deleted from within a function/method called by the timer, it may be easier to <a href="#OmitCallback">omit the <em>Function</em> parameter</a>. In some cases this avoids the need to retain the original object which was passed to SetTimer.</li>
</ul>
