; Using a Controller as a Mouse
; https://www.autohotkey.com
; This script converts a controller (gamepad, joystick, etc.) into a three-button
; mouse. It allows each button to drag just like a mouse button and it uses
; virtually no CPU time. Also, it will move the cursor faster depending on how far
; you push the stick from center. You can personalize various settings at the
; top of the script.
;
; Note: For Xbox controller 2013 and newer (anything newer than the Xbox 360
; controller), this script will only work if a window it owns is active,
; such as a message box, GUI, or the script's main window.

; Increase the following value to make the mouse cursor move faster:
ContMultiplier := 0.30

; Decrease the following value to require less stick displacement-from-center
; to start moving the mouse.  However, you may need to calibrate your stick
; -- ensuring it's properly centered -- to avoid cursor drift. A perfectly tight
; and centered stick could use a value of 1:
ContThreshold := 3

; Change the following to true to invert the Y-axis, which causes the mouse to
; move vertically in the direction opposite the stick:
InvertYAxis := false

; Change these values to use controller button numbers other than 1, 2, and 3 for
; the left, right, and middle mouse buttons.  Available numbers are 1 through 32.
; Use the Controller Test Script to find out your controller's numbers more easily.
ButtonLeft := 1
ButtonRight := 2
ButtonMiddle := 3

; If your controller has a POV control, you can use it as a mouse wheel.  The
; following value is the number of milliseconds between turns of the wheel.
; Decrease it to have the wheel turn faster:
WheelDelay := 250

; If your system has more than one controller, increase this value to use a
; controller other than the first:
ControllerNumber := 1

; END OF CONFIG SECTION -- Don't change anything below this point unless you want
; to alter the basic nature of the script.
